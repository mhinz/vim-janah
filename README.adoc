__NOTE__: No background color will be set if used in a terminal emulator. If
the colorscheme doesn't look good with your terminal's default background
color, put this in your vimrc:

```vim
autocmd ColorScheme janah highlight Normal ctermbg=235
colorscheme janah
```

If you set `'background'` in your vimrc, make sure to do that before setting
the above, because of a [Vim bug](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-janah/issues/2).
